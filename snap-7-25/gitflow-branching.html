<!--		1. In an html document, identify and describe the 5 types of branches that are part of Git Flow.-->
<!--		Describe how the work for one ticket would move through the various branches, and when those branches would be merged.-->
<!--		2.On many projects, developers use small snippets of code called patch files. These files outline small-->
<!--		differences  between one version of a file and another version. Create a text file, then, using git, create a-->
<!--		patch file that adds the phrase "I'm getting the hang of this git stuff." to a file in your snap challenge  by-->
<!--		running git apply my-patch.patch. Hint: You should not actually commit the writing you are adding with-->
<!--		my-patch.patch or the patch will fail!-->
		<h3>Git Flow</h3>
		<p>
			The main branch in Git Flow is called the master branch (1). It is the highest level branch and should never be
			modified directly except by "hotfix" branches (2) which should only be used to make emergency fixes to major
			problems with the code. The master branch should otherwise only be modified through merges from "release"
			branches (3), which sit one level above the develop branch, waiting for deployment to the master branch.
			Release branches are
			major modifications to code, not meant to be modified directly (except through merges with the "develop"
			branches, see below), and consist
			of all new code added during a sprint. Develop branches 4) are a level below release branches, and consist
			of all work merged from the lowest branch levels in Git Flow, "feature" branches (5). Develop branches are not
			ready to be made into a release branch, and are still actively having feature branches added into them. The
			feature branches are ticket-sized task branches that are subsequently merged into the develop branch when
			they are complete. By having multiple feature branches broken off from the develop branch you can have
			your team work on many tickets at a time without potentially disrupting upstream branches.
