<!--			In pseudocode, write a function that takes an array of numbers, and returns another array that counts the number of times each number appears in the array.-->
		let the array be equal to a variable


			<!--			In pseudocode, write a function that takes two integers. For each integer in between those two numbers (inclusive), output 'fizz' if the number is even, 'buzz' if the number is divisible by 3, and 'baz' without 'fizz' or 'buzz' if the number is divisible by both.-->
			function fizbuzzbaz
			iterate through a range of two integers, n and m, starting with n and ending with m, increasing by an integer every iteration
			if the integer divided by six is an integer, print baz
			else if the integer divided by three is another integer, print buzz
			else if the integer is divisible by 2, print fizz
			else do not print anything and continue with the iteration
